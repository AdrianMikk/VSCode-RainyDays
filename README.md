# Project Title

2022_CA_AdrianMikkelsen_RainyDays

## Description

A website made for Rain Jackets.
First website I've ever made with HTML & CSS.

## Changes from Figma

For the desktop version, I changed the navbar. I changed logo to the left side instead.

I removed the footer on mobile, because I thought it would be too much. And it looks more clean.

At the shop page I added Women as well.

Made some small changes to the product page. To make it look more nice and appealing.

There is no arrow on the confirmation page.

And the contact page has some small changes on desktop.

And on some of the backgrounds I added an overlay on the background image instead of blurring it, because I think it looks better.
